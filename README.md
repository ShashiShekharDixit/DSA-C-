# Daily DSA Questions (LeetCode & GeeksforGeeks)

This repository contains solutions to daily Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks (GFG). Each day, a new problem is solved and added to the repository with detailed explanations.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:


â”œâ”€â”€ LeetCode â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Problem1.md â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Problem2.md â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ... â”œâ”€â”€ GFG â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Problem1.md â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Problem2.md â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...


Each problem is solved and documented in its respective folder (LeetCode or GFG) along with:
- **Problem Statement**: A description of the problem.
- **Solution**: Explanation of the approach and logic used to solve the problem.
- **Code**: The solution in Python (or other language if applicable).
- **Complexity**: Time and space complexity analysis.
